#### Turn 7 (THERAPIST)

> Alright, let's focus on that then. Can you walk me through what happened during the code review, and what thoughts were going through your mind?

---

#### Turn 8 (PATIENT)

> So, I was presenting this new feature I'd been working on. And as I was going through it, I kept thinking 'They're going to find so many mistakes' or 'They probably think this is such amateur code.' Even when they were giving positive feedback, I was sure they were just being nice.

_Modality Events:_

- `Facial Expression`: Encouraging smile

---

#### Turn 14 (PATIENT)

> Um, I'd probably tell them that it's normal to feel nervous during code reviews. And that they're a good developer even if their code isn't perfect.

_Modality Events:_

- `Audio Emotion`: Voice softens (Confidence: 0.60)
- `Visual Analysis`: Softening of facial features, shoulders relaxing (Confidence: 0.70)
